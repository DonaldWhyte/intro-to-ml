            <ul>
              <li>A feature is some property that describes raw input data</li>
              <li>

Raw input data in the shape example before would be all of the pixels that make
up a shape, or even the raw binary data that makes up the image.

Other examples of raw inputs include each character in a document, each byte in
a file, every sample frequency in audio.

These inputs are highly complex and noisy, which makes it incredibly difficult
to identity patterns and infer greater meaning from the data.

So we abstract away the complexity using feature vectors, which significantly
reduce the dimensionality of the data.

* Added benefits:
  - remove redundant information
  - decreases time it takes to learn a good model
  - comprehensible by research (REFER TO PREVIOUS SLIDE)

            ### Why Use Feature Space?

            ![feature-extractor](images/feature-extractor.svg)

            * Could simply use raw binary data as input
            * Raw inputs are complex and noisy

          <section data-notes="
Finding a function, or model, that effectively discriminates between your inputs
is the goal of supervised learning.

We want to *classify* inputs by extracting salient features and passing the
resultant vector to a trained model. The model should be able to deduce the
correct output class by looking at where the input's feature vector lands in
feature space.

So for example, you would use classification to predict what type of animal is
in a picture. Generally, you would pre-define the output classes (e.g. cat, dog,
pidgeon) and construct a model that uses those classifiers.

If you wanted to predict the lifetime of a human, based on some attributes
about their lifestyle and current health, then you would use regression.
">
            ### Discrete or Continuous?

            * Classification
              - output is from a finite, discrete set
              - of *'classes'*
            * Regression
              - output is a real number from a continuous range

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
The point I'm trying to make here is that machine learning really just boils
down to three core aspects.

Extracting useful features from the input data, features that have some
correlation to the correct outputs, don't take an enourmous amount of processing
time to extract, and are not redundant (tell us the same thing as other features).

When trying to solve a problem with machine learning, I follow a multi-step
process rigorously. After looking into how others approach machine learning
problem, I found remarkable similaraties between my methodology and Jason
Brownlee.

Jason has done a much better job of formalising these steps, so I've listed his
personal process here.

[LIST STEPS]

Some of this may seem obvious, but formalising this stuff helps. I'm sure I'm
not the only one who's found myself getting off track and pursuing a tangent
that wastes hours, or even days, of my time. Now that I always keep these steps
in mind, I've personally found myself being a lot more systematic and getting to
good solutions faster.

First, we must understand the structure data. We can inspect the input features
ourselves and manually visualise the relation between each pair of features,
and the relation between each feature and the output class.

For example, let's suppose we want to predict the amount of frozen yoghurt
sold in one day. Suppose one of our data points is the highest temparature
during that day.

We can very clearly see linear relationship between temparature and yoghurt
sold. Hence, it makes sense to try out a linear regression model.

          <section data-markdown data-background="#fff" data-notes="
Suppose we want to predict if whether or not a person attended the Burning Man
festival in Nevada. Also suppose age and salary are two of the features we've
collected. When plotting the two features against the class, we see a clear
section in the feature space where burning

Discriminating between the two classes correctly requires us to split the feature
space in a non-linear way. Multiple discriminants are required to achieve this
discrimination.

One way we can do this is segment the feature space recursively, using a
technique called decision trees.

          <section data-markdown data-background="#fff" data-notes="
And also if we see our data has even more complicated boundaries, we can bring
out the big guns and try a neural network.

This is all well and good, but this process of manually comparing features and
classes is time consuming, especially when you have a large number of features
and many data points. Exploring and determining the structure of
high-dimensional datasets is time-consuming and complex.

We can do better than this.

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
So how do you select which algorithms to use?

Should we always hand-pick ourselves? Other than exploring the data to find the
right models being a time-consuming process, humans are prone to bias and
mistakes.

We have a tendency to pick algorithms we've used before, or make assumptions
about the shape of the decision boundary with little basis.

Solution? Let computers choose for us...

            Which algorithm to use?

            * Humans can be biased
